State the problem

Food Wastage
I have considered a restaurant with 3 types of cuisine - North, South and Fast Food. The table shows wastage each day.
Data is available for 30 days

Assumption - Data is already clean

Steps:
1. Import libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot

2. Read the data using pandas

3. Split the data into cuisine data in one table and the wastage in another

4. Use sklearn package to split data into training and testing. I took 20% data for testing and 80% for training

5. Now import the linearregression

6. Create regressor and train it using our data

7. Now test the regressor using test data X_test
